## Introduction ##

This project is an attempt to create an open source clone of the [Animal Crossing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing_(series)) video game. It will feature complex artificial intelligence, easy access networking, high level crafting, plot, goals, and should be easily extensible.

It should integrate as many features from the original [Animal Crossing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing) and [Animal Crossing: Wild World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_Wild_World) as possible.


## Expected Included Features (not all inclusive) ##
  1. Single player experience
  1. Multiplayer experience with up to 4 players locally.
  1. Up to 15 Animal Neighbors
  1. A General Store
  1. Trees that grow fruit on a regular basis
  1. Real-time progression (night & day, seasonal)
  1. Civic buildings (museum, post office, police station, lighthouse)
  1. Travel (other towns and tropical islands)
  1. Special visitors (including a musician)
  1. Thousands of items.
  1. Design capabilities (cloth designs, music, letters)
  1. Collection goals (insects, fish, fossils, paintings)
  1. Home rating system.
  1. Mini games (like the emulated NES Classics)
  1. Mini activities (sports day, holidays, snowmen)
  1. Birthday celebrations.

## Suggestions (from other people) ##
  1. Sharing of player instances/creations a la Spore (by andrew [FreeGameDev post](http://forum.freegamedev.net/index.php?t=msg&S=4bfa7f8c02fe2ad49f53921324d4efde&th=752&goto=5373#msg_5373))

## General Ideas ##
  1. Fabric and clothing design can be customized asymmetrically.
  1. Music composition is more complex: able to denote key, time signature, clef, tempo, sharps & flats, note lengths, multiple instruments, and integration into game music (environment and "bootlegs"); I'm thinking implementing this with [Music Markup Language (MML)](http://www.musicmarkup.info/).
  1. Since it's the only language I'm familiar with at the moment, [Java](http://www.java.com) is the planned language the project will be written in. It might be possible to implement the entire project in Java (excluding the resources such as graphics); I've read a little about the [Java3D API](https://java3d.dev.java.net/). [Bang!Howdy](http://www.banghowdy.com) was implemented in [jMonkey Engine](http://jmonkeyengine.com) (which is written completely in Java) so it is possible.
  1. Deeper character relationships, i.e. dating. Not sure how people would feel about Animal-Human relationships, but irregardless, it could make for some interesting situations.
  1. Ability to build other types of buildings; like movie theaters, malls, and such. I found it sad you could do just about nothing from the suggestions given to you from your neighbors.
  1. Deciding where to host all the project resources. If this ever takes off, the webhosting services at my university are not sufficient. Currently on Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/openanimalcrossing/)
