4. A General Store
5. Trees that grow fruit on a regular basis
6. Real-time progression (night & day, seasonal)
7. Civic buildings
8. Travel (other towns and tropical islands)
9. Special visitors (including a musician)
10. 100s of items
11. Design capabilities (cloth designs, music, letters)
12. Collection goals (insects, fish, fossils, paintings)
13. A Home rating system.
14. Mini games (like the emulated NES Classics)
15. Mini activities (sports day, holidays, snowmen)
16. Birthday celebrations.
